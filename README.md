# simplysocial

Building InVision's demo "simplysocial" in AngularJS and LESS CSS for fun and practice.


# Build

npm install
bower install
gulp

The solution will be serverd at http://localhost:8080


# Notes
- Created custom webfonts for icons
- Using simplified version of BEM for CSS syntax
- Could be using SCSS for CSS (chose LESS for simplicity of running it with NodeJs withouth dependencies)
- Not using LESS color functions at this point for not knowing the basic color palette yet
